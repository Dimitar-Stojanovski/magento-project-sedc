Testing registration process and purchase flow on a pilot e-commerce website.

The final project of SEDC academy was to test a whole flow of creating an account on a e-commerce website and adding to cart several products.
After completing, I was tasked to remove one product and proceed to checkout, entering the information about the shipping address and proceed to checkout.
I am using the Page Object Model for storing the methods and all validations and Data-Driven approach to exctract data for all the required fields.
